**Refresh Controller** can be initialized in a scheme to add refresh support.

::: warning IMPORTANT
It can only be used inside a **scheme**.
:::

## usage

Initiate **RefreshController** in constructor

```js
export class SchemeName {
  constructor (auth, options) {
    ...

    this.refreshController = new RefreshController(this)
  }

  ...
}
```

## methods

### `handleRefresh()`

Use this method to initiate a token refresh. It returns a promise which is resolved when refresh is completed.

Multiple requests will be queued until the first has completed token refresh.
