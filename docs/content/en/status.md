Auth module has two major versions to choose from:

## `@nuxtjs/auth-next` (v5)

This package has more documentation, features and many fixes landed but it's API is still in flux. (current docs)

We recommend that you use v5 via `@nuxtjs/auth-next`

However, you should fix your `package.json` to the *exact* version of `auth-next` that you develop
with to avoid updating with breaking changes since package is auto published.

## `@nuxtjs/auth` (v4)

This package is stable in regards of options and behavior but is missing many key improvements and may contain bugs.

Please see [nuxt-community/auth-module#893](https://github.com/nuxt-community/auth-module/issues/893) for more context.
