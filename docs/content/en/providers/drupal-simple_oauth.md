    'drupal/simple_oauth': {
      clientId: '...',
      clientSecret: '...',
      url: '<drupal url>'
    },
  }
}
```

Anywhere in your application logic:

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('drupal/simple_oauth')
```

This option is **REQUIRED**. To obtain one, create a Client Application by going to: `<drupal url>/admin/config/services/consumer/add`.

See the [Drupal Simple OAuth module](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) documentation for more details.
