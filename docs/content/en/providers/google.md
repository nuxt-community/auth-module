  strategies: {
    google: {
      clientId: '...'
    },
  }
}
```

this.$auth.loginWith('google')
```

üíÅ This provider is based on [oauth2 scheme](../schemes/oauth2) and supports all scheme options.

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('google', { params: { prompt: "select_account" } })
```


## Obtaining `clientId`

This option is **REQUIRED**. To obtain one, create your app in [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com), Create a new project and from Credentials tab, create a new "Oauth Client ID".
