‚ö†Ô∏è The Spotify provider is **still under development**, you can always use it in your local development.

## Usage

```js
auth: {
  strategies: {
    spotify: {
      clientId: '...',
      clientSecret: '...'
    },
  }
}
```

Anywhere in your application logic:

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('spotify')
```

üíÅ This provider is based on [oauth2 scheme](../schemes/oauth2) and supports all scheme options.

## Obtaining `clientId` and `clientSecret`

This option is **REQUIRED**. To obtain one, create your app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and use provided "Client ID" and "Client Secret".
