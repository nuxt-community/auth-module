auth: {
  strategies: {
      aad: {
        clientId: process.env.AAD_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.AAD_CLIENT_SECRET,
        tenantId: process.env.AAD_TENANT_ID,
        grantType: 'authorization_code'

## Obtaining configs

You need to create an app registration from Azure Portal and make sure to set up everything for an OAuth app in the usual way. e.g. whitelist urls.
