## Usage

```js
auth: {
  strategies: {
    facebook: {
      endpoints: {
        userInfo: 'https://graph.facebook.com/v6.0/me?fields=id,name,picture{url}'
      },
      clientId: '...',
      scope: ['public_profile', 'email']
    },
  }
}
```

Anywhere in your application logic:

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('facebook')
```

üíÅ This provider is based on [oauth2 scheme](../schemes/oauth2) and supports all scheme options.

## Obtaining `clientId`

This option is **REQUIRED**. To obtain one, create your app in [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com) and add "Facebook Login" product. Then set valid callback URLs. Client ID is same as your "App ID".
