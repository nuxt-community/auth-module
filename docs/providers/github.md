## Usage

```js
auth: {
  strategies: {
      github: {
        client_id: '...',
        client_secret: '...'
      },
  }
}
```

Anywhere in your application logic:

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('github')
```

💁 This provider is based on [oauth2 scheme](../schemes/oauth2.md) and supports all scheme options.

This option is **REQUIRED**. To obtain one, create your app in [Create a new Oauth APP](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and use provided "Client ID" and "Client Secret".
