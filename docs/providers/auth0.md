# Auth0

[Source Code](https://github.com/nuxt-community/auth-module/blob/dev/src/providers/auth0.ts)

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is a great authentication-as-a-service platform for free!

A [live demo](https://auth0.nuxtjs.org) is available as well as the [source](https://github.com/nuxt/example-auth0).

## Usage

```js
auth: {
  strategies: {
    auth0: {
      domain: 'domain.auth0.com',
      clientId: '....',
      audience: 'https://my-api-domain.com/'
    }
  }
}
```

Anywhere in your application logic:

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('auth0')
```

User will be redirected to a page like this:

üíÅ This provider is based on [oauth2 scheme](../schemes/oauth2.md) and supports all scheme options.

## Obtaining `clientId`, `domain`, and `audience`

`clientId` and `domain` are **REQUIRED**. Your application needs some details about this client to communicate with Auth0.

`audience` is required _unless_ you've explicitly set a default audience [on your Auth0 tenant](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant).

You can get your `clientId` and `domain` the Settings section for your client in the [Auth0 API dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). Your audience is defined on your [client's API](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis).

## Logout with new Auth0 tenants

On logout, local `auth` is reset and you will be instantly redirected to `Auth0` so your session is destroyed remotely as well. After that, you will be redirected back to your website by `Auth0`.

To make sure you are redirected to the right page, you need to setup two things:
* Go to into the `Tenant Settings` > `Advanced` and enter the allowed URL(s) you can redirect to in `Allowed Logout URLs`, such as `http://localhost:3000`
* Add `logoutRedirectUri` to your config and add the value you just configured:
```js
auth: {
  strategies: {
    auth0: {
      logoutRedirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000',
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can logout calling the `logout` function:

```js
this.$auth.logout()
```
