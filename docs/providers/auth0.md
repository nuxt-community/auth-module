# Auth0 Provider

[Source Code](https://github.com/nuxt-community/auth-module/blob/dev/lib/providers/auth0.js)

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is a great authentication-as-a-service platform for free!

## Usage

```js
auth: {
  strategies: {
    auth0: {
      domain: 'domain.auth0.com',
      client_id: '....',
      audience: 'https://my-api-domain.com/'
    }
  }
}
```

Anywhere in your application logic:

```js
this.$auth.loginWith('auth0')
```

User will be redirected to a page like this:

üíÅ This provider is based on [oauth2 scheme](../schemes/oauth2.md) and supports all scheme options.

### Obtaining `client_id`, `domain`, and `audience`

`client_id` and `domain` are **REQUIRED**. Your application needs some details about this client to communicate with Auth0.

`audience` is required _unless_ you've explicitly set a default audience [on your Auth0 tenent](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant).

You can get your `client_id` and `domain` the Settings section for your client in the [Auth0 API dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). Your audience is defined on your [client's API](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis).
